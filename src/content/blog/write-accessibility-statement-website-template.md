# How to Write an Accessibility Statement for Your Website (With Template)

An **accessibility statement** is a public page on your website that explains your commitment to digital accessibility, describes the current conformance status of your site, acknowledges known limitations, and tells users how to get help if they encounter a barrier. It is one of the most practical, high-impact pages you can add to any website, and yet most businesses either skip it entirely or publish a vague paragraph that fails to serve anyone.

Whether you run a web agency delivering client sites or you own a small business managing your own online presence, a well-crafted accessibility statement protects you legally, builds trust with your users, and gives your team a concrete framework for tracking and improving accessibility over time. This guide walks through everything you need to include, provides a complete copy-paste template, and explains how to keep your statement accurate as your site evolves.

## Why You Need an Accessibility Statement

Publishing an accessibility statement is not merely a nice gesture. There are three strong reasons every website should have one.

### Legal Good Faith and Risk Reduction

In the United States, courts evaluating ADA website accessibility claims routinely consider whether the organization has demonstrated a good-faith effort toward accessibility. A public accessibility statement that acknowledges your current status, discloses known issues, and outlines a remediation plan is tangible evidence of that effort. It does not make you immune to legal action, but it meaningfully strengthens your defense. For more detail on ADA requirements, see our [ADA compliance guide](/blog/ada-website-compliance-guide-small-businesses).

In the European Union, the requirement is more explicit. The European Accessibility Act (EAA), enforceable since June 2025, expects businesses providing covered digital services to document their accessibility conformance. While the specific format varies by member state, publishing a clear accessibility statement aligned with the EN 301 549 standard is the recognized way to demonstrate compliance. Our [European Accessibility Act guide](/blog/european-accessibility-act-2025-guide) covers the full scope of who must comply and what the law requires.

### User Trust and Transparency

People with disabilities visit your website with a practical question: can I use this? An accessibility statement answers that question honestly. It tells a screen reader user whether you have tested with assistive technology, tells a keyboard-only user whether your navigation is functional, and tells anyone encountering a barrier exactly how to report it and what to expect in response.

This transparency builds trust even when your site is not perfectly accessible. Users understand that accessibility is a process. What frustrates people is not the existence of barriers but the absence of any acknowledgment or path to resolution. A statement that says "we know about these issues and here is our plan" is far more respectful than silence.

### A Framework for Internal Accountability

Writing an accessibility statement forces your team to answer concrete questions: What standard are you targeting? What is your current conformance level? What barriers exist? When will you fix them? Who is responsible for responding to feedback?

For web agencies, this process becomes part of the deliverable for every client project. For small businesses, it turns accessibility from an abstract obligation into a defined checklist. The statement itself becomes a living document that tracks your progress.

## What to Include in Your Accessibility Statement

An effective accessibility statement covers six core components. Below is a breakdown of each one, with guidance on what to write.

### 1. Commitment and Scope

Open your statement with a clear declaration of your commitment to accessibility and specify what the statement covers. If you operate multiple sites or applications, define the scope explicitly.

**Key points to address:**

- Name the organization and the specific website or application
- State your commitment to making the site accessible to all users, including people with disabilities
- Clarify whether the statement covers just the main website, subdomains, mobile apps, or other digital properties

### 2. Standard and Conformance Level

Identify the technical standard you are targeting and your current level of conformance. For most websites, the target standard is **WCAG 2.1 Level AA**, which is the benchmark referenced by the ADA, the EAA, and most other accessibility regulations.

Be honest about your conformance status. The W3C defines three levels of conformance:

- **Full conformance:** The site meets all applicable success criteria at the stated level with no exceptions.
- **Partial conformance:** The site meets most criteria but has identified gaps.
- **Non-conformance:** The site does not yet meet the stated standard, but you are working toward it.

Most sites fall into partial conformance, and that is fine to state publicly. Claiming full conformance when you have known issues is worse than honestly acknowledging partial conformance with a clear remediation plan.

For a detailed walkthrough of every WCAG criterion, see our [WCAG compliance checklist](/blog/wcag-compliance-checklist-2026).

### 3. Known Limitations

This section is where many accessibility statements fail. Generic language like "some content may not be fully accessible" tells users nothing useful. Instead, list the specific limitations you are aware of, organized by type or by page. For each limitation, briefly explain:

- What the barrier is
- Where it occurs on your site
- What the impact is for users
- What you are doing to fix it (or any workaround available now)

**Example entries:**

- **Video captions:** Some older videos in the blog archive do not have captions. We are adding captions to all videos, prioritized by traffic, with an estimated completion date of Q3 2026.
- **PDF documents:** Several downloadable PDFs in our resources section are not tagged for screen reader accessibility. We are remediating these files and expect all current PDFs to be accessible by June 2026.
- **Third-party embedded content:** Our live chat widget is provided by a third-party vendor and does not fully support keyboard navigation. We have raised this issue with the vendor and are evaluating alternatives.

This specificity demonstrates genuine engagement with accessibility, not just performative compliance.

### 4. Remediation Timeline

Separate from the individual limitations, include a high-level timeline for your accessibility improvement efforts. This can be a brief statement like "We conduct quarterly accessibility audits and address critical issues within 30 days of identification." If you have a formal accessibility roadmap, reference it.

The remediation timeline reassures users (and regulators) that accessibility is an active, ongoing effort rather than a one-time project.

### 5. Contact Information and Feedback Mechanism

Every accessibility statement must include a clear way for users to report barriers and request help. This is not optional. Under the EAA, providing a feedback mechanism is an explicit requirement. Under ADA case law, the ability for users to request assistance is a factor courts consider.

**Include the following:**

- A dedicated email address (e.g., accessibility@yourdomain.com)
- An optional phone number for users who cannot use email
- A description of what happens after someone submits feedback (expected response time, who will review it)
- A note that users can request content in alternative formats if needed

Avoid burying the contact information in a generic "Contact Us" form. Use a dedicated, clearly labeled channel so the right person receives accessibility feedback directly.

### 6. Date and Review Cycle

State when the accessibility statement was last updated and how often you review it. This signals to users and regulators that the document is maintained, not abandoned.

**Example:** "This statement was last updated on February 25, 2026. We review and update this statement at least twice per year and after every major site redesign or audit."

### How to Customize the Template

When filling in the template, keep these practical tips in mind:

- **Be specific in the Known Limitations table.** Vague entries undermine the purpose of the section. If your automated scan found 12 images missing alt text across your product pages, say that.
- **Set realistic timelines.** Do not promise full conformance by next month if you have 200 issues in your backlog. Credibility matters more than optimism.
- **Use plain language.** Your accessibility statement will be read by people with varying technical backgrounds. Avoid jargon. Explain what WCAG is briefly rather than assuming everyone knows.
- **Keep the feedback channel actively monitored.** Publishing an email address you never check is worse than not publishing one at all. Assign a real person or team to own incoming accessibility feedback.

## Where to Publish Your Accessibility Statement

Your accessibility statement needs to be easy to find. Users who need it should not have to hunt for it. Follow these conventions:

### Footer Link

Add a link labeled "Accessibility" or "Accessibility Statement" to your website footer. The footer appears on every page, so this placement ensures the statement is always one click away regardless of where a user enters your site. This is the most widely adopted pattern and the one users with disabilities are most likely to look for.

### Dedicated URL

Publish the statement at a consistent, predictable URL. The most common choices are:

- `yourdomain.com/accessibility`
- `yourdomain.com/accessibility-statement`

A dedicated page at a clean URL is also easier to reference in legal documents, procurement responses, and compliance reports. Avoid burying the statement inside a generic "Legal" or "Policies" page where it competes with privacy policies and terms of service.

### Additional Placement

For web agencies building client sites, consider these additional placements:

- **Link in the site header** for sites where accessibility is a key differentiator
- **Reference in the website footer alongside "Privacy Policy" and "Terms of Service"** to signal that accessibility is treated with the same seriousness as legal compliance
- **Link within form error messages** or other areas where users might encounter barriers, directing them to the feedback mechanism

## Keeping Your Accessibility Statement Updated

An accessibility statement is only useful if it reflects the actual state of your website. A statement last updated two years ago with a remediation timeline that has long passed tells users your commitment was temporary. Here is how to keep it current.

### Tie Updates to Regular Scanning

The most reliable way to keep your accessibility statement accurate is to connect it to a regular scanning schedule. Every time you run a site-wide accessibility scan, review the results against what your statement currently says.

- Have any known limitations been resolved? Remove them from the table.
- Have new issues appeared after a redesign or content update? Add them.
- Has your conformance status changed? Update the conformance section.

[A11yScope's free scanner](/) can run automated WCAG checks across your site, giving you a clear picture of your current status whenever you need it. Use the scan results as the source of truth for your statement's Known Limitations section.

### Set a Review Cadence

At minimum, review your accessibility statement twice per year. Better yet, review it quarterly. Put it on the calendar. The review does not need to take long, especially if you are already running regular scans. A 30-minute review of your latest scan results against the current statement is usually sufficient.

### Update After Major Changes

Any significant change to your website should trigger a statement review:

- Site redesigns or platform migrations
- Addition of new features or interactive components
- Changes to third-party integrations (chat widgets, payment processors, embedded content)
- Content management system updates

### For Web Agencies: Build It Into the Deliverable

If you build websites for clients, include the accessibility statement as a standard deliverable in every project. Create a version of the template pre-filled with the client's information and the results of your initial accessibility audit. Then set the client up with ongoing scanning so the statement stays current after handoff.

This is a tangible value-add that differentiates your agency and demonstrates professionalism. Clients may not ask for it, but they will appreciate it when you explain the legal and reputational benefits.

## Automate the Hard Part

Writing the accessibility statement is straightforward once you know the format. The harder part is knowing the actual state of your site: which WCAG criteria you pass, which you fail, and what has changed since your last review.

That is the problem automated scanning solves. Rather than manually auditing hundreds of pages every quarter, you can run a comprehensive scan that identifies issues across your entire site and tracks changes over time.

A11yScope is built for exactly this workflow. The free tier lets you scan your site and identify issues. The [Pro plan](/#pricing) adds scheduled weekly scans, historical tracking, and detailed reports that map directly to the sections of your accessibility statement. When your scan shows 14 images missing alt text on your product pages, you know exactly what to put in the Known Limitations table. When next month's scan shows you have fixed 12 of them, you know it is time to update the statement.

Start with a scan. Write your statement using the template above. Then keep both your site and your statement improving over time.

## Summary

An accessibility statement is not a legal shield or a marketing exercise. It is a practical document that serves real people trying to use your website. It tells users what works, what does not, and how to get help. It tells regulators you take the requirement seriously. And it tells your own team exactly where you stand and what comes next.

**The essential components of every accessibility statement:**

- A clear commitment to accessibility, with the scope defined
- The standard you are targeting (WCAG 2.1 AA for most sites) and your honest conformance status
- Specific known limitations with remediation plans and timelines
- A monitored feedback channel with a stated response time
- The date of the last update and your review schedule

Use the template in this article as your starting point. Fill in the specifics based on your latest scan results. Publish it at a predictable URL linked from your footer. Then revisit it every time you scan your site.

Accessibility is an ongoing process, not a destination. Your accessibility statement should reflect that reality, evolving alongside your website as you identify and resolve barriers. That is what genuine commitment looks like.
