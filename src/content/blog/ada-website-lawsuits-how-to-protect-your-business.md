# ADA Website Lawsuits: How to Protect Your Business From Legal Action

ADA website lawsuits have become one of the fastest-growing categories of civil litigation in the United States. Every year, thousands of businesses  Efrom Fortune 500 corporations to single-employee online shops  Ereceive demand letters or face formal legal complaints alleging that their websites are inaccessible to people with disabilities. The financial consequences are significant, the reputational damage is real, and the legal landscape is only getting more aggressive. If your business has a website, this is a risk you cannot afford to ignore.

This guide breaks down exactly what the Americans with Disabilities Act requires for your digital presence, why enforcement has accelerated so dramatically, and what concrete steps you can take right now to reduce your exposure.

## What Does the ADA Require for Websites?

The Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law in 1990, long before the commercial internet existed. Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination by "places of public accommodation," a category that originally referred to physical locations like restaurants, hotels, and retail stores.

The critical legal question for the past decade has been whether websites qualify as places of public accommodation. Courts across the country have increasingly answered yes.

### The DOJ's Position on Web Accessibility

The U.S. Department of Justice has consistently taken the position that the ADA applies to websites. In 2022, the DOJ issued updated guidance explicitly stating that web accessibility is covered under Title III. In 2024, the DOJ went further by publishing a final rule under Title II requiring state and local government websites to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, Level AA standard.

While the Title II rule applies directly to government entities, it sends an unmistakable signal about where federal enforcement priorities are heading for private businesses under Title III. Courts have already been citing WCAG 2.1 AA as the benchmark in private litigation for years.

### WCAG 2.1 AA: The De Facto Legal Standard

Although no federal statute explicitly mandates WCAG compliance for private-sector websites, WCAG 2.1 Level AA has emerged as the standard that courts, regulators, and plaintiffs' attorneys use to evaluate accessibility. The guidelines are organized around four principles. Your website must be:

- **Perceivable**  EContent must be presentable in ways that all users can detect, including those who are blind, deaf, or have low vision.
- **Operable**  ENavigation and interactive elements must work for users who rely on keyboards, voice commands, or assistive technologies instead of a mouse.
- **Understandable**  EText must be readable, interfaces must behave predictably, and users must receive help avoiding and correcting errors.
- **Robust**  EContent must be compatible with current and reasonably future assistive technologies, including screen readers.

Failing to meet these criteria is what exposes your business to ADA website lawsuits.

## ADA Website Lawsuit Trends: The Numbers Are Alarming

The volume of digital accessibility lawsuits filed in the United States has grown substantially over the past several years. The trend line is steep and shows no sign of flattening.

### Year-Over-Year Growth

Industry analyses consistently show that federal ADA website accessibility lawsuits have grown from a few hundred per year in the mid-2010s to several thousand per year by the mid-2020s. When you add state-level filings  Eparticularly under aggressive state laws in New York and California  Ethe total number of annual claims is even higher. Some estimates place the combined federal and state total well above four thousand filings per year.

These numbers do not capture the full picture. Many disputes are resolved through pre-litigation demand letters that never appear in court records. For every lawsuit that gets filed, multiple additional businesses receive demand letters threatening legal action unless they pay a settlement and remediate their websites.

### Who Is Getting Sued?

A common misconception is that only large companies get targeted. The reality is quite different:

- **E-commerce businesses** of all sizes are frequent targets, because online stores have clear commercial functions that courts readily classify as places of public accommodation.
- **Small and mid-sized businesses** are often preferred targets for serial plaintiffs because smaller companies are more likely to settle quickly rather than endure expensive litigation.
- **Restaurants, hotels, and service providers** with online booking or ordering systems face elevated risk because their websites are direct extensions of their physical operations.
- **Healthcare providers** face both ADA exposure and additional regulatory pressure around patient portal accessibility.

No industry is immune. If your website offers goods, services, or information to the public, you are within the scope of potential enforcement.

### The Rise of Serial Plaintiffs

A significant portion of ADA website lawsuits are filed by a relatively small number of plaintiffs and law firms that specialize in high-volume accessibility litigation. Some individual plaintiffs have been named in hundreds of lawsuits. Courts have occasionally pushed back on perceived abuse of the litigation process, but the fundamental legal claims remain valid  Eif a website is inaccessible, the ADA provides a cause of action regardless of the plaintiff's motives.

This means your website does not need to attract the attention of a dissatisfied customer with a disability. It only needs to be found by one of the plaintiffs' firms that systematically scan the internet for accessibility violations and file claims at scale.

## Common Website Issues That Trigger ADA Lawsuits

Understanding what accessibility failures actually look like in practice is essential for evaluating your own risk. The following issues appear repeatedly in ADA website complaints.

### Missing or Inadequate Alternative Text

Images without descriptive alt text are invisible to screen reader users. This is one of the most frequently cited violations in accessibility lawsuits. Every meaningful image on your site  Eproduct photos, informational graphics, icons that convey function  Eneeds accurate alternative text.

### Inaccessible Forms and Checkout Processes

If a user who relies on a screen reader or keyboard navigation cannot complete a purchase, submit a contact form, or book an appointment on your website, that is a serious accessibility barrier. Common problems include form fields without associated labels, error messages that are not announced to assistive technology, and submit buttons that cannot be activated with a keyboard.

### Poor Color Contrast

Text that does not have sufficient contrast against its background is difficult or impossible to read for users with low vision or color vision deficiencies. WCAG 2.1 AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Many modern website designs prioritize aesthetics over readability and fail this requirement.

### Keyboard Navigation Failures

Not all users can operate a mouse. Users with motor disabilities, visual impairments, or certain neurological conditions depend on keyboard navigation. If your website has dropdown menus, modals, carousels, or interactive elements that cannot be reached and operated with the Tab and Enter keys alone, you have a keyboard accessibility gap.

### Missing Page Structure and Headings

Screen readers rely on proper HTML heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3) and landmark regions to help users navigate pages efficiently. Websites that use headings purely for visual styling  Eor that skip heading levels  Ecreate a confusing and disorienting experience for users of assistive technology.

### Auto-Playing Media Without Controls

Video or audio content that plays automatically without accessible controls to pause, stop, or adjust volume creates barriers for users with auditory, cognitive, or seizure-related disabilities.

### Third-Party Content and Widgets

Your liability extends to third-party components embedded on your site. Chat widgets, embedded maps, social media feeds, payment processors, and booking engines that are not accessible can all be the basis for an ADA claim against your business  Eeven though you did not develop them.

## The Real Cost of an ADA Website Lawsuit

Business owners often underestimate the financial and operational impact of an accessibility lawsuit until they are in the middle of one.

### Legal Fees and Settlement Costs

Defending an ADA website lawsuit typically costs tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees, even if you prevail. Most businesses choose to settle rather than litigate, with settlement amounts commonly ranging from several thousand to tens of thousands of dollars. Repeat or class-action claims can be significantly more expensive.

### Injunctive Relief and Remediation Deadlines

Courts and settlement agreements typically require the defendant to bring their website into WCAG conformance within a fixed timeline, often six months to a year. Rushed remediation under legal pressure is almost always more expensive than proactive compliance work done on your own schedule.

### Reputational Damage

An ADA lawsuit becomes a matter of public record. For consumer-facing brands, the association with disability discrimination  Eeven if the lawsuit is ultimately resolved  Ecan erode customer trust and generate negative press coverage.

### Ongoing Monitoring Obligations

Many settlement agreements require businesses to conduct periodic accessibility audits and submit compliance reports for a period of years. This creates ongoing administrative costs that extend well beyond the initial resolution.

## How to Protect Your Business From ADA Website Lawsuits

The most effective defense against an ADA website lawsuit is straightforward: make your website accessible before a plaintiff's attorney finds the violations for you. Here is a practical roadmap.

### Step 1: Conduct a Comprehensive Accessibility Audit

You cannot fix what you have not identified. Start with a thorough audit of your website against WCAG 2.1 Level AA criteria. This should combine automated scanning tools  Ewhich can efficiently detect many technical violations  Ewith manual testing that evaluates the real user experience for people who rely on assistive technology.

Automated tools alone are not sufficient. Industry research consistently indicates that automated scanners can detect only a portion of WCAG violations. The remaining issues require human judgment to identify.

### Step 2: Prioritize and Remediate Critical Issues

Not all accessibility issues carry equal legal risk. Focus first on the barriers that prevent users from completing core tasks on your website:

- **Can a screen reader user navigate your site and understand the content?**
- **Can a keyboard-only user complete a purchase, fill out a form, or access essential information?**
- **Is your content readable for users with low vision?**

Fix these critical-path issues first, then work through the remaining violations systematically.

### Step 3: Address Your Design and Development Process

One-time fixes are not enough. Accessibility must be integrated into your ongoing design and development workflow. Every new page, feature, or content update should be evaluated for accessibility before it goes live. Train your team on accessibility fundamentals. Include accessibility acceptance criteria in your development process.

### Step 4: Publish an Accessibility Statement

An accessibility statement on your website demonstrates good faith and provides users with a way to report barriers they encounter. While an accessibility statement alone does not shield you from litigation, it signals that your organization takes accessibility seriously and is actively working toward compliance. Include contact information so users can request assistance or report issues.

### Step 5: Implement Continuous Monitoring

Web accessibility is not a one-time project. Websites change constantly  Enew content is added, plugins are updated, designs are refreshed. Each change can introduce new accessibility barriers. Continuous monitoring ensures that you catch and fix regressions before they become the basis for a legal complaint.

### Step 6: Document Your Compliance Efforts

Maintain records of your accessibility audits, remediation work, and ongoing monitoring. If your business does face a legal challenge, documented evidence of good-faith efforts to achieve and maintain compliance can significantly strengthen your legal position and may influence settlement negotiations in your favor.

## Accessibility Overlays: Do They Protect You?

Some businesses turn to accessibility overlay widgets  EJavaScript tools that add a toolbar to your website claiming to fix accessibility issues automatically. It is important to understand that these overlays have significant limitations.

Multiple major accessibility advocacy organizations have publicly criticized overlay products. Overlays generally cannot fix underlying code-level accessibility problems. They may interfere with the assistive technology that users already rely on. And critically, overlay widgets have not prevented businesses from being sued. Several companies have faced ADA lawsuits specifically while using overlay products on their websites.

Genuine accessibility requires fixing your website's code, content, and design  Enot layering a cosmetic tool on top of existing barriers.

## The Legal Landscape Is Only Getting Stricter

Several developments suggest that ADA website enforcement will continue to intensify:

- **Federal rulemaking is expanding.** The DOJ's Title II web accessibility rule establishes a regulatory precedent that may extend to private-sector requirements under Title III.
- **State laws are adding new obligations.** States like New York and Colorado have enacted or proposed legislation that creates additional accessibility requirements beyond the federal ADA.
- **Plaintiff activity is growing.** The infrastructure of serial accessibility litigation  Especialized law firms, automated violation scanning, established legal precedents  Econtinues to mature.
- **Consumer expectations are rising.** As digital accessibility awareness grows among the general public, businesses that fail to provide accessible experiences face increasing pressure from customers, not just attorneys.

Waiting to address accessibility is a strategy that becomes riskier with every passing quarter.
