## FAQ

Q: What is WCAG 2.1?
A: WCAG 2.1 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) is the international standard for web accessibility published by the W3C. It defines how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities, organized into four principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.

Q: Is A11yScope free?
A: Yes, A11yScope offers a free tier with 3 scans per month. No account or credit card is required to start scanning.

Q: How does A11yScope scan websites?
A: A11yScope uses a headless browser (Puppeteer) to fully render your page including JavaScript, then runs axe-core — the same engine used by major accessibility tools — to check against 38+ WCAG 2.1 AA rules.

Q: What's the difference between automated and manual accessibility testing?
A: Automated tools like A11yScope can detect about 30-40% of WCAG issues (missing alt text, contrast errors, missing labels, etc.). The remaining issues require manual testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation. A11yScope covers the automated portion thoroughly and flags areas needing manual review.

Q: Do I need WCAG compliance for my website?
A: If you operate in the US, ADA Title III has been interpreted to cover websites. In the EU, the European Accessibility Act (EAA) requires digital accessibility by June 2025. Many lawsuits have been filed — over 4,000 ADA web accessibility cases in 2023 alone.

Q: What is axe-core?
A: axe-core is an open-source accessibility testing engine maintained by Deque Systems. It's the industry standard used by Google Lighthouse, Microsoft Accessibility Insights, and many other tools. A11yScope is built on axe-core.
